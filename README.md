# hello-world
Just being courteous.
And also creating a hello-world file here on Git-hub. As you might already know, in the programming world Hello-world is now almost a long standing tradition, which I am also following on GitHub.
Hoping to work, collaorate with fellow programmers on useful, interesting or innovative softwares.
See you around.
